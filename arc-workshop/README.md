# Arc enabled Kubernetes Workshop

This workshop will help you deploy two arc enabled Kubernetes clusters - one in Azure using AKS, and another using Rancher Desktop. You'll then walk through deploying a sample application to both, and understanding how to expose the sample application (in AKS to the public, and for Rancher Desktop to your local network). This is meant to help people understand what deploying and managing workloads across environments entails with a hands on approach.
